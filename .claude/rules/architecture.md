# Architecture Rules

## Hexagonal Architecture

All infrastructure is abstracted behind **shared ports** (interfaces). Adapters implement these ports. Business logic (regions) never imports infrastructure directly.

```
src/buri/
├── ports/      # Interfaces (abstract base classes)
├── adapters/   # Implementations of ports
└── regions/    # Business logic (the six regions)
```

## Layer Rules

- **Regions** import from `ports/` only, NEVER from `adapters/`
- **Adapters** import from `ports/` for interfaces they implement
- **CLI/main** imports from everywhere (it's the composition root)

## The Six Regions

| Region | Function | Cycle Time | Model Size |
|--------|----------|------------|------------|
| **Sköll** | Rapid perception, threat detection, interrupts | ~1s | Nano |
| **Hati** | Pattern recognition, analysis, classification | ~5s | Medium |
| **Sága** | Memory, continuity, keeper of self (Minni) | ~10s | Medium + Vector |
| **Móði** | Deliberate reasoning, planning, decisions | ~30s | Large |
| **Váli** | Creative thinking, alternatives, dreaming | ~5min | Large (high temp) |
| **Víðarr** | Meta-cognition, self-observation, calibration | ~5s | Medium |

## Communication

- **Synapses (nng)** — All inter-region communication (~10-50μs latency)
- **Distributed Blackboard** — Shared state (attention, felt sense, working memory)
- **Files** — Persistence only (Minni YAML, PID files, logs)

No Redis. No external state store. Just nng for communication and files for persistence.

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Never build custom auth/token layers** — always delegate to standard OIDC/OAuth2 flows
- **IDP-agnostic** — code must not be coupled to a specific identity provider (Keycloak, Entra ID, Okta, etc.). Use the identity adapter pattern to abstract the IDP
- All authentication goes through Envoy + the configured IDP in production
- Service-to-service auth uses standard OIDC flows (e.g. `client_credentials` grant), not internal bypasses or custom tokens
