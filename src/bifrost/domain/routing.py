"""Routing domain logic: rule evaluation before strategy selection.

``apply_rules`` is the single entry-point called by the ``ModelRouter`` before
it builds provider candidates.  It delegates to whichever ``RuleEnginePort``
implementation is configured, and handles five possible outcomes:

* ``route_to``     — returns a copy of the request with the model overridden.
* ``reject``       — raises ``RuleRejectError`` (callers map this to HTTP 400).
* ``log``          — emits a full-level audit log entry, returns the request unchanged.
* ``tag``          — emits an audit log entry with metadata tags, returns the request unchanged.
* ``strip_images`` — returns a copy of the request with all image blocks removed.
