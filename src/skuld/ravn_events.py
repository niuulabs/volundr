"""RavnEvent — typed intermediate event emitted by the Ravn agent system.

:class:`RavnEvent` is the structured event that Ravn (the Claude Code CLI
agent system) emits.  It acts as a transport-agnostic intermediate
representation that is then translated to a :class:`~sleipnir.domain.events.SleipnirEvent`
by :class:`~skuld.ravn_translator.RavnEventTranslator` before being published
to the Sleipnir event bus.

Translation mapping
-------------------
- :attr:`RavnEvent.type`           → ``event_type`` (via :attr:`RavnEventType.value`)
- :attr:`RavnEvent.source`         → ``source``
- :attr:`RavnEvent.payload`        → ``payload``
- :attr:`RavnEvent.urgency`        → ``urgency``
- :attr:`RavnEvent.correlation_id` → ``correlation_id``
