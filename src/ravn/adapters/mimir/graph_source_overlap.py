"""SourceOverlapGraphAdapter — MimirGraphPort backed by shared source_id edges.

Pages that reference the same raw source_id are considered related.  This is
the same logic used by ``GET /mimir/graph`` in ``mimir.router``, extracted into
a proper hexagonal adapter so it can be swapped without touching the router.

Future alternatives: ``SemanticSimilarityGraphAdapter`` (embeddings),
``TypedRelationGraphAdapter``.
