"""AskUserTool — agent-intercepted tool for collecting user input.

This tool is declared to the LLM so it knows it can ask the user for
clarification.  Actual execution is intercepted by the agent loop
(``RavnAgent._intercept_ask_user``) before dispatch reaches this class.

The ``execute`` method is intentionally unreachable — it exists only to
satisfy the ``ToolPort`` interface.

    When the LLM calls ``ask_user``, the agent loop intercepts the call,

    This tool should be added to the agent's tool list when an interactive
    ``user_input_fn`` is available.
