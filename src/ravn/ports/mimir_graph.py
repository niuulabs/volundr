"""MimirGraphPort — abstract interface for computing document relationship graphs.

Implementations derive connection edges between wiki pages and expose related-page
lookups so the staleness trigger and synthesis persona can follow concept clusters.

Hexagonal design: swap implementations without touching business logic.
Initial implementation: ``SourceOverlapGraphAdapter`` (shared source_id → edge).
Future: ``SemanticSimilarityGraphAdapter`` (embeddings), ``TypedRelationGraphAdapter``.
