"""SpawnPort — protocol for creating and terminating ephemeral Ravn instances (NIU-435).

Spawned instances register with DiscoveryPort on startup.  The coordinator
waits for them to appear in the peer table before delegating work.

Two adapters are provided:
- ``SubprocessSpawnAdapter`` — ``ravn daemon`` subprocess with tempfile config
- ``KubernetesJobSpawnAdapter`` — Kubernetes Job with the Ravn container image
