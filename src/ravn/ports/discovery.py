"""DiscoveryPort — realm-scoped flock peer detection (NIU-538).

Discovery is orthogonal to transport (MeshPort).  This port covers:

- **Announcing** this Ravn's presence to the network
- **Scanning** for candidates and running the trust handshake
- **Maintaining** a live, verified peer table
- **Watching** for join/leave events

``peers()`` is intentionally synchronous because the mesh adapters (NngMeshAdapter,
SleipnirMeshAdapter) call it from synchronous helper methods during ``send()``
and ``_connect_sub_to_peers()``.  Implementations maintain an in-memory peer
table that is updated asynchronously by background tasks.
