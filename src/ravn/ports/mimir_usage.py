"""MimirUsagePort — abstract interface for tracking wiki page access frequency.

Implementations record which pages are read and surface the most-frequently-accessed
pages so the staleness trigger can prioritise refresh work.

Hexagonal design: swap implementations without touching business logic.
Initial implementation: ``LogBasedUsageAdapter`` (parses log.md query entries).
Future: ``RedisUsageAdapter``, ``PostgresUsageAdapter``.
