"""Sleipnir event type constants.

All event types are defined here as module-level constants to avoid magic
strings throughout the codebase. Import the constant, not the string literal.

Organised by namespace:

- ``RAVN_*`` — Ravn agent events
- ``TYR_*``  — Tyr autonomous dispatcher events
- ``VOLUNDR_*`` — Volundr platform events
- ``BIFROST_*`` — Bifrost gateway events
- ``SYSTEM_*`` — Infrastructure and lifecycle events
