"""In-process asyncio event bus adapter for Sleipnir.

This transport uses asyncio queues and in-memory dispatch — zero network
overhead. Suitable for standalone Ravn, tests, and single-process Pi mode.

Each subscriber gets its own bounded asyncio.Queue served by a consumer task.
Overflow evicts the oldest event with a warning log (ring buffer semantics).
