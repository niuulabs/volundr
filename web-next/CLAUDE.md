# Niuu Web (`web-next/`)

This is the new, composable, plugin-based UI for the Niuu platform. It replaces the
monolithic `web/` app and supersedes the prototype demos in `web2/niuu_handoff/`.

**Read this first in any new session.** It captures the non-negotiable architecture
and the rationale — not a log of past work.

---

## Scope for this branch

While `feat/web-next-scaffold` (and any descendant branches) is active:

- **Work happens inside `web-next/` only.** Do not modify `web/`, `src/` (Python
  backend), `tests/` (Python), `containers/`, or other parts of the monorepo unless
  explicitly asked. If a fix genuinely needs to cross the boundary, surface it and
  wait for direction — don't silently edit.
- **Python unit tests are disabled for this branch.** The backend test suite is
  frozen while we focus on `web-next/`. Do not spend cycles getting them green.
- **`web/` unit/e2e tests are disabled for this branch.** Same reason.
- **Only `web-next/` tests run in CI.** See `.github/workflows/` for the gating.

This is a speed play. When `web-next/` reaches parity on the first plugin vertical,
we re-enable the other suites. Until then, green CI = `web-next` tests green.

---

## Non-negotiable architecture

### 1. Every plugin is its own publishable package

A consumer must be able to `npm install @niuulabs/plugin-tyr` and embed Tyr in their
own page without pulling in the rest of Niuu. This is the primary design constraint.
Everything else flows from it.

```tsx
// A third-party app using only Tyr:
import { Shell } from '@niuulabs/shell';
import { ConfigProvider, ServicesProvider, FeatureCatalogProvider } from '@niuulabs/plugin-sdk';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@niuulabs/design-tokens';
import { createQueryClient } from '@niuulabs/query';
import { QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { tyrPlugin, type ITyrService } from '@niuulabs/plugin-tyr';
import '@niuulabs/design-tokens/tokens.css';
import '@niuulabs/ui/styles.css';
import '@niuulabs/shell/styles.css';

<ConfigProvider endpoint="/config.json" fallback={<Loading />}>
  <ThemeProvider theme="ice">
    <QueryClientProvider client={createQueryClient()}>
      <ServicesProvider services={{ tyr: myTyrAdapter }}>
        <FeatureCatalogProvider>
          <Shell plugins={[tyrPlugin]} />
        </FeatureCatalogProvider>
      </ServicesProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>
</ConfigProvider>;
```

### 2. Hexagonal architecture per plugin

Every plugin package follows the same internal shape:

```
plugin-<name>/
├── src/
│   ├── domain/        pure value objects, no framework imports
│   ├── application/   use cases (orchestrate domain + ports)
│   ├── ports/         interfaces (I<Name>Service, I<Name>Stream)
│   ├── adapters/      implementations (http / ws / mock) — optional per plugin
│   ├── ui/            React components, pages, hooks
│   └── index.ts       exports: <name>Plugin (PluginDescriptor), ports, domain types
```

Rules:

- `ui/` may import from `application/`, `domain/`, `ports/`. Never from `adapters/`.
- `adapters/` implement `ports/`. Consumers can ignore the built-in adapters and
  inject their own.
- Business logic lives in `application/` and `domain/`, not in components.

### 3. Services via dependency injection, never imported directly

Components get services from `useService<T>(key)`. The consumer wires adapters in
`<ServicesProvider>`. **Plugins never import concrete service implementations.**

```ts
// inside plugin-tyr:
const tyr = useService<ITyrService>('tyr'); // contract only
```

```ts
// inside apps/niuu/src/services.ts:
import { buildTyrApiAdapter } from '@niuulabs/plugin-tyr/adapters/http';
const services = { tyr: buildTyrApiAdapter(config.services.tyr) };
```

Tests and Storybook supply mock adapters. Adapter swap = zero component changes.

### 4. TanStack Query wraps services — it does not replace them

The services abstraction (ports + adapters + DI) is unchanged from `web/`. TanStack
Query is the client cache on top. Every API call looks like:

```ts
export function useSagas() {
  const tyr = useService<ITyrService>('tyr');
  return useQuery({ queryKey: ['tyr', 'sagas'], queryFn: () => tyr.getSagas() });
}
```

Server state → Query. Client-only UI state → Zustand (when needed).

### 5. Runtime config, not build-time

`apps/niuu/public/config.json` is fetched on boot by `<ConfigProvider>` and validated
with Zod. Operators edit the file and refresh the browser — no rebuild. The config
declares which plugins are enabled, service URLs, theme, auth config.

Three feature-flag tiers, any of which can hide a plugin:

1. **Install-time** — `apps/niuu/src/plugins.ts` imports; not imported = not bundled
2. **Runtime operator flags** — `public/config.json` `{ plugins.<id>.enabled }`
3. **Runtime per-user flags** — backend `FeatureCatalog` (future; same port pattern)

### 6. Design tokens are the source of truth for styling

`@niuulabs/design-tokens` owns `tokens.css`. It is ported verbatim from
`web2/niuu_handoff/flokk_observatory/design/tokens.css` and is the single source of
truth for color, spacing, typography, motion, and theme (ice / amber / spring).

- **Single brand theme policy** — default is `ice`. App does not theme-switch per plugin.
- Components use CSS custom properties (`var(--color-brand)`, `var(--space-3)`).
- Do **not** hard-code hex colors or pixel values in component CSS.
- Tailwind is allowed _inside plugin packages_ if needed, but must compile to values
  driven by the token variables. Consumers should not need to install Tailwind.
- CSS files are prefixed (`.niuu-chip`, `.niuu-shell__rail`) so multiple packages
  can ship CSS without collisions.

### 7. Routing is code-based, not file-based

TanStack Router routes are constructed in code and composed by the Shell from
`PluginDescriptor.routes`. File-based routing cannot cross package boundaries, so it
is incompatible with composability. This is a deliberate trade.

### 8. `web-next/` never imports from `web/` — copy, don't cross-reference

`web/` is going to be deleted. Any reuse from there is done by **copying files**
into their new home in `web-next/`, not by importing across the boundary. This
keeps `web-next/` self-contained and means deleting `web/` at M8 is a safe op.

When a ticket says "copy from `web/...`", the workflow is:

1. Open the source files under `web/src/...` as reference.
2. Copy them (or their essence) into `web-next/packages/<pkg>/src/...`.
3. Rewrite imports: `@/modules/shared/...` → `@niuulabs/...`.
4. Migrate the tests alongside — they must pass in the new location.
5. Verify `grep -r "from ['\"].*\\.\\./.*web/" web-next/` returns nothing.

Known sources we'll copy (not exhaustive — see individual tickets):

| From `web/`                                   | To (web-next)                   | Ticket  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| `src/modules/shared/api/client.ts`            | `@niuulabs/query` (HTTP client) | NIU-688 |
| `src/modules/shared/ports/identity.port.ts`   | `@niuulabs/plugin-sdk`          | NIU-688 |
| `src/modules/shared/ports/feature-catalog..`  | `@niuulabs/plugin-sdk`          | NIU-688 |
| `src/modules/shared/adapters/*.ts`            | `@niuulabs/plugin-sdk`          | NIU-688 |
| `src/auth/*`                                  | `@niuulabs/auth`                | NIU-651 |
| `src/modules/mimir/api/*`                     | `@niuulabs/plugin-mimir`        | NIU-667 |
| `src/modules/ravn/api/*`                      | `@niuulabs/plugin-ravn`         | NIU-671 |
| `src/modules/tyr/{ports,adapters,models}/*`   | `@niuulabs/plugin-tyr`          | NIU-679 |
| `src/modules/volundr/{ports,adapters,models}` | `@niuulabs/plugin-volundr`      | NIU-675 |
| `src/modules/shared/components/SessionChat/`  | `@niuulabs/ui/chat`             | NIU-660 |

Nothing else should be dragged across — and especially no UI components outside
`SessionChat`, which get rebuilt fresh against the design tokens.

### 9. Module boundaries — what goes where

| Live in `@niuulabs/ui`                             | Live in a specific plugin             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Used by 2+ plugins                                 | Used by only one plugin               |
| Design-system primitives (Chip, StateDot)          | WorkflowBuilder (tyr), RaidMesh (tyr) |
| Cross-plugin composites (PersonaAvatar, MountChip) | TopologyCanvas (observatory)          |
| Layout/overlay/form/data primitives                | TemplateEditor (volundr)              |

**Promotion rule:** start plugin-local, promote to `@niuulabs/ui` as soon as a second
plugin needs it. Cheap to move.

Cross-plugin **domain** types (Persona, Mount, ToolRegistry, EventCatalog, Budget)
live in `@niuulabs/domain` (to be added when first needed) — not in a plugin.

## Stack

- **React 19** (StrictMode in dev)
- **TypeScript 5.7** — strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- **Vite 7** — app + Storybook builder
- **pnpm 9** workspaces
- **TanStack Router** — code-based routes
- **TanStack Query** — server state caching
- **Zod** — runtime config validation
- **Vitest + React Testing Library** — unit tests, 85% coverage minimum
- **Playwright** — e2e
- **Storybook 9** — single workshop at workspace root, globs `packages/*/src/**/*.stories.tsx`
- **tsup** — library builds for each package (ESM only)
- **ESLint flat config + Prettier** — code style

## Explicitly not used

- **Monaco / `@codingame/monaco-vscode-*`** — dropped. File manager covers file ops.
  If read-only syntax-highlighted viewing is needed later, reach for `shiki` or
  `prism-react-renderer` (~50KB).
- **Vercel AI SDK UI** — we have our own `SessionChat/` implementation (to be ported
  from `web/src/modules/shared/components/SessionChat/`).
- **File-based routing** — see rule 7.
- **CSS-in-JS / styled-components / emotion** — runtime cost, not needed.
- **Tailwind as a consumer dependency** — consumers only need `tokens.css`.
- **ORM** — doesn't apply here (backend concern), but noted for consistency.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install            # install workspace deps (first thing in a fresh clone)
pnpm dev                # run @niuulabs/niuu at :5173
pnpm storybook          # run Storybook at :6006
pnpm test               # vitest run with coverage
pnpm test:watch         # vitest watch
pnpm test:e2e           # playwright test
pnpm typecheck          # project-reference-aware tsc
pnpm lint               # eslint
pnpm format             # prettier
pnpm build              # build all packages, then the app
```

## Git hooks — install once per clone

The workspace ships a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` at the repo root that catches the
same errors CI would catch, before you round-trip to GitHub:

- **pre-commit** (runs on every `git commit`, ~2s): prettier + eslint auto-fix on
  staged files under `web-next/`
- **pre-push** (runs on every `git push`, ~30s): builds all packages, runs
  `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (coverage gate), and `pnpm format:check`

Install both hook types once:

```bash
# from the workspace root (not web-next/)
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
```

If pnpm isn't on your `PATH`, either `corepack enable` (recommended — ships with
Node 16.10+) or install pnpm globally. The hooks extend `PATH` to cover the
common install locations (`~/.npm-global/bin`, `~/.local/share/pnpm`,
`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`).

**Do not skip `pre-push` with `--no-verify`.** If a hook fails, fix the issue.
Every failure a dev sees locally is a failure that would otherwise waste a CI
run and a round-trip.

## Coverage thresholds — non-negotiable

Configured in `vitest.config.ts`: **85% statements / branches / functions / lines**.

This is **a hard CI gate, not a suggestion.** `pnpm test` runs with coverage and
fails the run if any threshold falls below 85%. Do not lower the thresholds to get
a PR through. If coverage drops, write the tests.

- Every new component ships with at least one test that exercises rendering and
  any state or variant logic.
- Every new hook ships with tests that cover happy path, loading, and error states.
- Every new port/adapter ships with tests for the full contract surface.
- Bug fixes ship with a regression test.

CI runs `pnpm test` (unit, with coverage) AND `pnpm test:e2e` (Playwright) on every
push. Both gates must pass. Playwright is part of CI from the start — do not defer it.

Every new plugin page, feature flow, and shell interaction ships with a Playwright
spec in `e2e/`. Specs cover at least:

1. The happy path (user can reach the feature and see its core content)
2. Loading state (before data resolves)
3. One error state (service fails, empty state, or permission denied)
4. Keyboard accessibility where the feature has interactive controls (tab order,
   ⌘K opens, Escape closes, etc.)

---

## Runtime config shape

See `packages/plugin-sdk/src/config.ts` for the Zod schema. Example:

```json
{
  "theme": "ice",
  "plugins": {
    "observatory": { "enabled": true, "order": 1 },
    "tyr": { "enabled": true, "order": 4 },
    "volundr": { "enabled": false, "order": 5, "reason": "k8s not provisioned" }
  },
  "services": {
    "tyr": { "baseUrl": "https://api.niuu.world/tyr", "mode": "http" },
    "volundr": { "baseUrl": "https://api.niuu.world/volundr", "mode": "http" }
  },
  "auth": {
    "issuer": "https://auth.niuu.world",
    "clientId": "niuu-web"
  }
}
```

Edit `apps/niuu/public/config.json` and refresh the browser. No rebuild.

---

## How to add a new plugin

1. `pnpm -F @niuulabs/plugin-sdk build` (or whatever you're branching off).
2. Create `packages/plugin-<name>/` mirroring `plugin-hello/` — `package.json`,
   `tsconfig.json`, `tsup.config.ts`, `src/{ports,adapters,domain,application,ui}`,
   `src/index.ts` exporting a `definePlugin({...})`.
3. Add the package name to `apps/niuu/package.json` deps and reference in
   `apps/niuu/tsconfig.json`.
4. Import and list it in `apps/niuu/src/plugins.ts`.
5. Wire its mock service in `apps/niuu/src/services.ts` (real adapter when ready).
6. Add to `apps/niuu/public/config.json` under `plugins` + `services`.
7. Write stories for every shared component you add.

## Common pitfalls

- **Don't import from `adapters/` in components.** Components depend on `ports/`
  through DI. If you see `import { buildTyrAdapter } from '../adapters/...'` inside
  `ui/`, that's a bug.
- **Don't hard-code plugin IDs in the shell.** Shell reads `plugins` prop + config.
- **Don't hard-code colors.** Use `var(--color-*)` / `var(--brand-*)`. Red is
  reserved for failures — use `var(--color-critical)`, never a brand color.
- **Don't add a component to a plugin if a sibling plugin already needs it.** Promote
  to `@niuulabs/ui` on the spot.
- **Don't bypass `ConfigProvider`.** All env-dependent values (URLs, flags, theme)
  come from config, not from `import.meta.env`.
- **Don't publish with amend.** Commits matter; each package has its own version.
