## Session lifecycle

```
CREATED → STARTING → PROVISIONING → RUNNING → STOPPING → STOPPED → ARCHIVED
                                         └──→ FAILED
```

- `CREATED` — session record exists, no pods running
- `STARTING` — pod creation requested
- `PROVISIONING` — pods created, waiting for readiness
- `RUNNING` — pods ready, endpoints available
- `STOPPING` — stop requested, pods being torn down
- `STOPPED` — pods removed, session data retained
- `FAILED` — infrastructure error
- `ARCHIVED` — soft-deleted, can be restored

## Create session

```

  "branch": "main",
  "template_name": "python-project",
  "preset_id": "uuid"
}
```
